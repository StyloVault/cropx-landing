          we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and

        You have the right to:
        <br />
        Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject
        access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal
        data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        <br />
        Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This
        enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
        corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
        provide to us.
        <br />
        Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
        delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us
        continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or
        remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your
        right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed
        your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
        personal data to comply with local law.
        <br />
        Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your
        request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to
        you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        <br />
        Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a
        legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
        about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
        processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental
        rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are
        processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some
        cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
        process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
        <br />
        Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables
        you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the
        following scenarios:
        <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
        <li>
          Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as
          you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
          whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        </li>
        Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
        We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal
        data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that
        this right only applies to automated information which you initially
        provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
        perform a contract with you. Withdraw consent at any time where we are
        relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not
        affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw
        your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to
        provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this
        is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
